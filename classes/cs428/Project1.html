                <p>This project is a collection of AR widgets for use in everyday life.
                    The idea is to develop widgets that can be scattered around your house
                    to display information at a glance much like the widget’s real analogs.
                    By holding up your android smartphone (or a camera and the unity editor) to
                    paper markers you can view a clock displaying local time, a calendar
                    displaying local date, a humidity and temperature display, wind speed and
                    direction display as well as the current condition display all for the city
                    of Chicago. This project represents coursework for cs428 at UIC. This project
                    represents a personal introduction into AR development.</p>

                <h1 class="open-sans-cond">How To Run</h1>
                <p>Project Link: <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyVenturella/CS428-Project-1" target="_blank"> GitHub</a></p>

                <h5>To Run on PC/Laptop:</h5>
                    <p>Requires Unity 2019.4.1f1 (or compatible) to be installed on device to
                        view and edit project (linked below). Vuforia 9.3.3 is installed and
                        setup already in the project so there is no need to install it. To run,
                        open the project up in unity, and make sure you are in scene
                        “SampleScene”. Click on the “Weather Manager” child under the “Managers”
                        game object in the hierarchy. Insert your API key from openweathermap.com
                        replacing my key in the “API KEY” field in the inspector. You will need
                        a webcam attached to your pc and image targets printed out from Vuforia
                        (Astronaut, Drone, Fissure, Oxygen, And Mars) click on the play button
                        to run in editor. Bring the image targets up to the webcam and you should
                        see the widgets appear with current information about local time/date
                        and weather information for Chicago.</p>

                <h5>To Run on Android:</h5>
                    <p>Included with the git repo is an .apk file in the “Android Build” folder.
                        Install this on your android device and run. You will need image targets
                        printed out from Vuforia (Astronaut, Drone, Fissure, Oxygen, And Mars),
                        bring your devices camera over these image targets and you should see
                        the widgets appear with current information about local time/date and
                        weather information for Chicago. To rebuild follow the above steps in
                        “To Run on PC/Laptop” (including replacing my API key) and instead of
                        running in editor go to File > Build settings select platform Android
                        (android module must be installed and setup for your unity version) and
                        select build. It will build you an .apk file to a location you chose,
                        transfer that to your device and run.</p>

                <h4>Built Using:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.1" target="_blank">Unity 2019.4.1f1</a></li>

                </ul>

                <p>Above are the supported versions for code within this project.</p>

                <p>Each widget is controlled by a unique mars database fiducial marker, click links
                    below to download them. They can be printed out or used displayed on a device
                    (printed for best results).</p>

                <p>In the future I can see these types of widgets being used alongside some sort of AR glasses a user always has with them. Its use would probably be very similar to their real-life counterparts just with abilities that lie far outside of what can be achieved physically. Having these “glance-ables”, objects we can glance at and get information quickly (like a clock or thermostat), are just one of those conveniences we rely on. Its why I (and I assume you) have about a half-dozen ways to tell time within eyeshot right now. We rely on these types of glance-able objects to give us information about the weather, time, date, notifications, etc. Having these as AR widgets we can bring about a better more creative way to display this type of information. For example, say your office does not have a window, an AR widget can be one. You can have a virtual nonexistent landscape in eyeshot that shows you current weather conditions, current time of day, or if the weather or time isn’t doing it for you, you can always see what its like out in Hawaii. What makes this special is that its always there, its not meant to be actively observed like a television but passively at a glance its supposed to give you information. </p>

                <p>However, there’s an argument to be said in its novelty. All of the information I’m displaying with these widgets can be displayed in some form or another as a regular old 2D widget on your computer. Windows 10 has a clock in the bottom right corner with the date, and it even tells you the weather in the start menu. So why would you need or want it in some 3D form? And that’s a tough question to answer. Is it in its ability to go with you and display anywhere? You can argue you have your phone for that. Is it in your ability to display them throughout your home? You can argue that I’d make more sense to have physical devices, so you don’t always have to be wearing some device to get the information. The problem for me is trying to justify the novelty with other reasons it would be popular, because novelty is fine. Physical is fine. And the popularity may come in a form of a blend of the two. </p>

                <p>Owning a physical device that can toggle an AR overlay may be vastly more popular. Let’s say my friend owns a calendar. This calendar viewed by anyone shows the day of the month, year, etc. It looks just like a normal calendar. But my AR glasses prompt me with a discrete toggle switch, and I press it. Suddenly the boring old calendar lights up with my schedule, events, birthdays. The pictures of cats suddenly turn to pictures of dogs. It becomes my calendar. This is the novelty of AR I would like, sure my calendar is in my pocket on my phone, but this is now a glance-able. This is in the room with me in eye shot if I need the information. Its open to a glance, just like my clock on my friends’ desk, my phone book next to their phone, and my favorite tv show on their TV.</p>
