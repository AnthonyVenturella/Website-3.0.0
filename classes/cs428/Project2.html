                    <p>This project is an AR playset containing a virtual me sitting at my desk as
                       I make this project. There is also a version of my desk that contains
                       collisions allowing AR objects to interact with it. The idea is to have a
                       more physical connection to the AR world giving a few ways to interact with
                       the environment. Included is also a small subproject of me experimenting
                       with depth masks in AR. By holding up your android smartphone (or a camera
                       and the unity editor) to fiduciary markers you can have a virtual me appear
                       into the scene where you can interact via a button, another can let you view a
                       virtual representation of my desk with collisions and bouncy balls. This
                       project represents coursework for cs428 at UIC.</p>

                    <p>Project Link: <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyVenturella/CS428-Project-2" target="_blank"> GitHub</a></p>

                    <h5>To Run Both Playset+Collisions and Ground Plane on PC/Laptop:</h5>
                        <p>Requires Unity 2019.4.1f1 (or compatible) to be installed on device to view and edit project
                            (linked below). Vuforia 9.4.6 is installed and setup already in the project so there is no
                            need to install it. To run the playset and the collisions open the project up in unity and
                            make sure you are in scene “MainScene”. You will need a webcam attached to your pc and
                            image targets printed out from below (Astronaut, Drone, Oxygen) click on the play button
                            to run in editor. Bring the image targets up to the webcam and you should see a desk playset
                            popup with the astronaut marker, desk collisions will be created with the drone marker (use
                            space to toggle visualization), and a bonus “secret room” can be visualized with the oxygen
                            marker. This last one was created more for fun and isn’t a deliverable for this project.
                            To visualize the life-size ground plane tracker version, switch scene to “GroundPlane” and
                            using a printed out ground plane marker (link below) on the floor bring it into the cameras
                            view and click on the marker in the unity editor. This will cause the playset to appear life
                            size over the marker.</p>

                    <h5>To Run Ground Plane App on Android:</h5>
                        <p>Included with the git repo is an .apk file in the “Android Build” folder. Install this on
                            your android device and run. You will not need any of the image targets printed out, instead
                            bring your devices camera over a clearing in your floor and tap on the ground where you’d
                            like to see the playset spawned. To rebuild go to File > Build settings select platform
                            Android (android module must be installed and setup for your unity version) and select build.
                            It will build you an .apk file to a location you chose, transfer that to your device and run.</p>

                    <p>Above are the supported versions for code within this project.</p>

                    <p>The playset and collisions are controlled by unique mars database fiducial markers (astronaut, drone, oxygen) and the goundplane can be viewed with a groundplane marker or with the android app, click links
                        below to download them. They can be printed out or displayed on a device
                        (printed for best results).</p>

                    <p>These playsets can serve as a very popular playset in an AR-inclined future. In my own childhood I loved the worlds I created out of Lego or the imaginary environments my mind made up as I played with other toys. With these type of AR playsets, a child/parent can place themselves and make anything they want into the environment around them and interact with it as if it were in the room. This is a power I would have loved as a kid. To have the ability to interact with something one made themselves with a virtual toy chest of things to interact with would probably open up a new outlet in the realms of creativity and imagination for kids. In this, these playsets can serve as a bridge between something store-bought, and something personally created such as a crayon drawing. With this a kid would easily be express themselves as freely as they would like and show their family and friends what they’ve made. I can absolutely see these personalized playsets supplanting the parent’s collection of fridge drawings.
	Interacting with ones self can be surreal, in this project the version of “me” isn’t great as I couldn’t find much clothing or hair styles/colors that matched me, but with refinement on the character creation side it can be made to look very close to yourself. I can see a much younger me ordering legions of little-me’s to capture my evil sisters fort or playing some AR game against myself. In this I believe kids would love to interact with a figure of them and as an extension their families. But even other then them and their family I believe it would open a lot of doors to enhancing a child’s play time. “Teatime” can be had not only with a collection of stuffed animals but also at a castle complete with custom AR characters. Likewise, AR characters and scenes can be used by kids to bring barbie/Gi-joe scenes to life. As well as playing dress up on the virtual them. The possibilities to enhance a child’s play time seem to be great.
	Interacting with a life-size versus a scaled model is a very different feeling. The small scale seems to resemble more a toy, something that has presence, but lacks a sense of space. It ends up feeling more like a toy or a prop then anything substantial. However, interacting with a full-scale “me” brings a feeling of size. Rather than interacting with small hand help objects you feel a presence inside of the room with you, something you instinctively walk around rather than through. The full size “me” feels less of a toy and much more of a tangible object. I’m not sure if this is a relic of me getting older but I feel more compelled to interact with this full-scale version. When testing I got closer and inspected shadows and details in the scene much more then on the tiny scale, finding myself getting close to the objects. To me the large-scale was much more interesting in that it “felt” like it was there.
