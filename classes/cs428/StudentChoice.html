            <h1 class="open-sans-cond">Student Choice: BONEWORKS</h1>

            <p>BONEWORKS is a VR game created by <i>Stress Level Zero</i>. What differentiates it from similar VR titles is its focus on a fully physics-based environment. Every object tool, weapon, creature as well as the players body has weight behind it and interacts with the environment as you would expect it would in the real world. This use of VR takes the idea of presence within a virtual world to an extreme. It uses a custom tracking algorithm to estimate where the players limbs will be and displays the players body in what logical position a human can achieve. The intention of this game is to have it available to be played by VR video game players, and to probe into the limits of a more physics-based player model. The physics creates some issues when playing, namely as some one experienced in VR it reproduces the early nausea I had when I first started playing with VR.</p>

        Boneworks has, as a consequence of its physicality, firearm recoil that is not only noticeably felt in its site picture recovery but also can be viewed on the player arm itself. Since recoil is a force applied by the firearm it will push the players arm realistically away. To mitigate this the player needs to brace with a second hand and control shots or else the recoil forces will flail the hands wildly as they compound. Firearms also respond physically with the environment forcing a player to keep that in mind as they try to peak around corners or go into tighter hallways. This is traditionally not handled and usually results in the ability to fire through objects or at the vary least have a weapon stick into them. In a VR world immersion is everything and Boneworks tries to bring that sense of presence closer with its physicality.

                Boneworks has with it a decent barrier to entry. It intends for its users to have already achieved their “VR legs”. Foregoing all locomotion types other then continuous, it is not for those prone to VR sickness. Just like the introduction of the dual stick controller, it has become a staple of VR games to include with them various movement types. Usually there will be an option for teleport (something that is much easier on the nausea) along side the option for continuous movement. This creates a situation where a massive filter exists at the entrance to the game forbidding anyone who even has mild VR sickness. With this in mind, the game is clearly not intended for newcomers or the mass of the VR playing community, but rather is an enthusiast’s game inside what is already an enthusiast’s industry.

        Boneworks pushes to change away from the standard way player models have interacted with the environment such as those seen in traditional 3D games and their subsequent adoption for VR games. Like VR itself it breaks away from designing a game as if it were being observed through a camera on a monitor. Rather than have a simple collision mesh for the player with static arms sticking out into the middle of the screen and having limited interactivity with the environment, in Boneworks hands and whatever they’re holding interact with everything. If you try to walk up to a wall with something in your hands, rather than the floating hands continuing to hold the item in front of you (the consequences of how traditional games are designed) the object collides with the environment forcefully. A consequence of this action (one which may be traditionally remedied by having the player suddenly stop) is that newtons laws come into play. If I charge a wall carrying some object and I strike the wall the object as well as myself will suddenly be flying backwards. This is a simple consequence of the everything’s physical approach that the developers at stress level zero have taken.

            <h1 class="open-sans-cond">Inertia and the player</h1>
            <p>
                The player model isn’t just affected by the ability to bounce off the walls. In most traditional games when swinging weapons you don’t usually have to worry about making collisions with the wall and those walls consequently stopping all the inertial you’ve built up in a swing however, in Boneworks you do. A swing of a sledge hammer realistically lags behind as you struggle to swing its weight and given not enough room (be it by a wall an enemy or a low ceiling) you wont have enough inertia to damage anything. It’ll be more like throwing a punch while inside a coffin. The damage system dictates that damage inflicted requires not only mass but speed, and as a consequence it dictates that in order to achieve speed you need to apply more force i.e. a much longer swing. This builds up a melee system that blows traditional systems like those found in Skyrim VR out of the water. You end up feeling every swing as well as every impact, and you need to more tactful in how and where you make your swings. Compare this to the rapid wrist flicking of Skyrim VR and you can see the advancements a system like this has made in VR.
