                    <p>This is the third and final project in CS428. The design goal of the project was to create a dream classroom in VR while maintaining social distancing from COVID-19. In this dream classroom environment, I implemented a stage with interactable and playable instruments, a desk containing all the things I would normally bring to class or that I would want to bring to class. Included in this dream classroom is a fully stocked kitchen and an array of space themed props. The main goal of the project was interaction, so all the props around the room that are small can be picked up and the large props were given interactions where appropriate. All characters are also interactable playing both a sound and animation when you enter their sphere of influence.

                        <p>To download the project, you can download directly from the repository linked above or from one of the releases linked below that. Release v1.0 is the project deliverable release, all after are additions to it.

                    <h5>Running in Unity Editor</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                You will need to have <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download" target="_blank"> Unity Hub</a> installed with the unity version below (it should be able to work with newer versions but for best results use unity version 2019.4.1)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After unity is installed and setup you can open the application via the hub or by “Open Project” in the editor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After it is open you may notice an empty scene, to fix this go below to the scene folder and double click on EVL. This will take you to the classroom scene.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Since VRTK is preinstalled all you have to do after the scene is open is hit play and it will run in the simulator or your headset if its plugged in.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Now pick items up, interact with the people, play some music, and have some fun!
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h5>How to Build and Run</h5>
                    <p>
                        The application can also be built and run by going to “file” and “Build Settings”. Here make sure to include the EVL scene previously mentioned in the “Scenes to Build” list then select either “Build” or “Build And Run”
                    </p>

                    <h4>Built Using:</h4>

                    <p>This project allowed for a very unique experience. Having previously had a class in the room I was to edit and reimagine in VR, brought a weird level of detail to the experience. Interacting with an environment that you previously spent a large amount of time in but now in VR has similarities to that feeling you get seeing your home in 3D on some sort of online mapping software. It gives off this sense of familiarity where you know where everything is and you can imagine yourself there, but it still feels a little abnormal. I don’t know how best to describe this feeling, its like knowing a place but the quirks of how you’re visualizing it make it seem brand new and different. In this same way the interactions and the representations of people in the space seem different and new. It’s awesome especially in VR to walk into this classroom and feeling the walls and ceilings as you would if you had walked into the real physical class. All the dimensions feel right, and after adding in people they feel like they occupy the space naturally. It creates a situation where you feel present and occupying a space alongside the objects and representations of people that are also there. It may be a purely synthetic world but when immersed in VR your brain treats it like its real. The sound coming from the other side of the room can be clearly identified, or distance from people and objects can be clearly felt all because your brain still remembers locations of objects in this VR space as if it were in reality. This type of classroom environment definitely would open doors to learning experiences in online classes. Being able to interact with teachers or students in the same physical but VR environment could help with the online learning experience. Or even to step away from an active student role, the same kind of tech can be used to trial run different class layouts on real people without having to have to build them. For example UICs new classroom layouts they’re designing based on classrooms around the world, if they wanted to go toward an even more extreme type of classroom they could prototype the design in VR and teach a few classes in the environment and gauge how students like the changes. This would allow students and teachers to interact with one another in the unique layouts until a perfect balance of layout is found. This type of 1:1 representation in VR can also be easily adapted by architects. Instead of showing clients blueprints of a design and having them imagine the project, large buildings can be rendered in VR allowing the clients to walk through their rooms and make changes before the designs ever break ground. Or in designing a project the typical amount of traffic that is estimated to be seen can be thrown into a VR representation and the designers can gauge if more room is needed and where.</p>
